# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. It is a video game concept where the player maneuvers a dot and grows it by ‚Äòeating‚Äô pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and the growing snake becomes an obstacle to smooth maneuvers. The goal is to grow it to become as big as possible without bumping into the side walls, or bumping into itself, upon which it dies.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

Before you can run this client, you will need to be running the server side which you can download and install from here.

## Credit Where Credit Due

The server code for this game was not written from scratch. It is a heavily modified version of the single player game Snek created by [Tania Rascia](https://github.com/taniarascia "Github Link"). The demonstration GIF above is taken from the single-player version. It gives us a general idea of the gameplay and style, but ours is a heavily modified multi-player version of the game.
